These are not typical chess. The rules of this game are different from normal chess. This game was created as a recruitment task based on the rules provided by the recruiter. The starting position of the pieces is different than normal, and not all the pieces are present. The queen can only move one square at a time, and the king can only move in the directions up/down/right/left. The game ends not with a checkmate, but when we capture the king.
